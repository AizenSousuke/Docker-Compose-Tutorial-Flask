## Description
This is an example of what docker compose could achieve. It will spin up containers for a flask application that uses redis:alpine as a database of some sort. 

### To run:
Make sure you have **Docker** installed.
```
docker-compose up
```

Go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the app.
